Configurable options:
    x Destination folder
    x Which packages to include
    - How to map source location to online viewable source code
    - If source code should be viewable at all

Index page with Readme file?

Markdown parsing in documentation notes, and readme file?
    - This is mostly done for now

Mark active package selection
    x Probably need to regenerate the package hierarchy per page

Add documentation for:
    x `#distinct`
    interfaces   <- This will be hard
    type aliases
    operator overloads

Add ability for description at the package level
    `#package_doc`?
    `#doc "..." package foo`?
